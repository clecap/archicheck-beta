This document will protocol my testing approaches in regards of testing the Archi-check fronted.
The frontend consists out of three parts that can be tested. Firstly the JavaScript code implementation, secondly
the interaction and look of the UI as well as its usability in regards of understanding and learning it and lastly inputs
you can feed into the application.

In this document I will extend on the prior not testable things from the previous testing document, which were:
- UI testing
- Testing Fact Checks for this Website
- Testing Add Fact Checker
- Options
