# Archicheck for fact checking #

![image](https://github.com/clecap/archicheck/blob/main/frontend/ui/128.png)

# Introduction:

The idea behind Archicheck is to have an architecture that allows users to view and publish critical comments or remarks about the content of any given
website in the World Wide Web they're currently on. These comments can either come from other users or already established fact-checking sites you can subscribe to.
By subscribing to different fact-checking sites (e.g. [correctiv.org](https://correctiv.org/)), the user has the opportunity to compare their stated facts and check them for potential inequalities. 

# Project goal:

The aim of the Archicheck project is to implement a web extension / plug-in that shows an overview of the existing comments that can be switched on and off. We also want to turn every browser into a fact-checking web server in order to counter the monopoly of the big tech companies and their algorithms.
