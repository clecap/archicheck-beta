### In this document you will find a description and an overview of the rules for using the project board and the Github branches

-------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Project board:
The status of the issues is shown on the project board and is divided into four categories.

* **Meetings:** this category includes the meetings each as an individual issue that explain what needs to be discussed.
And also the information of the meeting (e.g. date, participants, tasks, etc.)

* **TODOS:** This category includes the tasks that have to be processed as issues.

* **in progress:** This category includes the tasks that are in progress as issues.

* **done:** This category contains the tasks that have been processed (completed), the issues are automatically added when they are closed.


### rules:


mainly everyone can create and manage issues. the issues are automatically added to the project board when the corresponding project is assigned.
The issue is then automatically added to the TODO category, but it can be assigned to the corresponding category and closed at the end.
The protocol group and github management group can create the necessary issues regarding the tasks.

-------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Branches:
branches are used to freely test new functionality. In the branches you can constantly update the files, and in the end those branches are merged with the main branch so that only the final version of the files is on the main branch.


### rules:


mainly each issue should have its own branch and only be merged when the issue is closed or resolved


-------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Markdown:

Document should be in MD format. The document should be written in MD notation and not html or other notations.
