The following decisions were made in the developing process and provide guidance for further developments.
- project goal: create a browser extension to check facts on websites
- write the developer / contact person at the beginning of each code
- initially client server architecture, later eventually P2P
- initially feature complete, not pixel perfect → create basic functionality

- component description: https://github.com/clecap/archicheck/blob/main/narrative-description/Components%20description/README.md/
- GitHub policy: https://github.com/clecap/archicheck/blob/main/github-policy.md
- how to make ‘GET publishers/*’ compatible with p2p? → global popularity counter → bitcoin-based solution (difficult, but works)
- testing depending on date
- provide an adequate detailed documentation in code
