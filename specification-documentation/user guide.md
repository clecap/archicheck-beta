## Introduction
The idea of Archicheck is to allow you to view and publish critical comments or remarks about the content of any website in the World Wide Web you are currently on. These comments can either come from other users or already established fact-checking sites you can subscribe to. By subscribing to different fact-checking sites, you have the opportunity to compare their stated facts and check them for potential inequalities.
